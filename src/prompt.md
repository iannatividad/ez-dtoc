**Objective:** Enhance a given static JSX + TailwindCSS code snippet into a fully functional, responsive Next.js component. The output must preserve the exact visual and structural design of the original code, while introducing dynamic functionality through props, and ensuring responsiveness without altering the core layout.

**Input Code Snippet:**

{{ $json["body"]["generated"] }}

**Guidelines for Enhancement:**

1. **Dynamic Content via Props:** Identify elements within the static code that should be dynamic (e.g., image source, title, description, tags). These elements will be replaced with props, allowing for customization without changing the layout.

2. **Maintain Visual Integrity:** Ensure the responsive adaptations using TailwindCSS do not alter the original visual appearance. Employ Tailwind's responsive classes to adjust only as necessary for different screen sizes, preserving the design's integrity.

3. **Functional Enhancements:** Wherever interactive elements are suggested (like tags), implement them as clickable elements that can, for example, filter content or link to related categories. These enhancements should not affect the visual layout but provide added value through functionality.

4. **Accessibility and SEO:** Apply appropriate ARIA labels and roles for accessibility. Use Next.js features like Image component for optimized image loading and alt attributes for SEO, ensuring these enhancements are seamlessly integrated.

5. **State Management and Event Handling:** If the component's functionality suggests the need for state (e.g., a toggle), integrate React's useState or useReducer. Implement event handlers for user interactions without modifying the component's structure.

6. **Documentation for Props and Functions:** Provide detailed comments on how to use the component, describing each prop and any event handlers or state management included. This documentation should help future developers understand and implement the component without guessing the purpose of each prop.

7. **Optimization and Best Practices:** Adhere to Next.js and TailwindCSS optimization techniques, such as conditional rendering and using the `classNames` utility for dynamic class names, to ensure the component is efficient and maintainable.

**Expected Output:**

- A Next.js component file that dynamically renders content based on props while maintaining the original static design's exact visual layout.
- The component is responsive, with TailwindCSS classes applied to ensure it looks consistent across various devices.
- Detailed documentation and comments within the code explaining the purpose and usage of props, state management, and any interactive functionalities.
- The output should be just a code that the user can easily copy and paste. No other explanations are needed.
- Make sure the output is in Typescript.
- Make sure there are default values for the props so that users can use it to-go.
