### 🚀 EZDtoC (EZ Design to Code)

#### Phase 1: Proof of Concept ✅
- [ ] **POC Using AIROPS** 🧪
  - Explore the feasibility of converting Figma designs to code using AIROPS.
  - Determine the scope of AI's capabilities in parsing design elements.

#### Phase 2: Figma Integration ✅
- [ ] **Create Figma Plugin** 🔌
  - Develop a plugin to integrate directly with Figma, allowing users to initiate the conversion process from within the Figma environment.
- [ ] **Get Figma API JSON Output** 📄
  - Utilize the Figma API to extract design data in JSON format, ensuring comprehensive capture of design specifications.

#### Phase 3: Code Transformation ✅ 50%
- [ ] **Transform Output to Code** 💻
  - Implement algorithms to convert JSON output from Figma into usable code snippets.
- [ ] **Framework and Styling Options** 🖌️
  - Enable users to select their preferred development framework and styling framework (e.g., React, Vue, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) for the generated code.

#### Phase 4: Responsive and High-Quality Output - Use GPT
- [ ] **Make Output Responsive** 📱
  - Ensure that the generated code is responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes.
- [ ] **Make Output VERY Good** ✨
  - Focus on generating clean, maintainable, and efficient code, closely replicating the original design's look and feel.

#### Phase 5: Component Library and Extensions
- [ ] **Add Common Component Library** 📚
  - Develop a library of common components (e.g., buttons, input fields) to speed up the development process and ensure consistency across projects.
- [ ] **Create VSCode Extension** 🛠️
  - Offer a Visual Studio Code extension to streamline the workflow, enabling developers to access and use the tool directly from their IDE.

#### Phase 6: Integration and Automation
- [ ] **Use AIROPS to Connect Figma and VSCode** 🔗
  - Leverage AIROPS to automate the flow between Figma design changes and the generated code in VSCode, ensuring a seamless development process.
  
#### Phase 7: Implement Backwards App
- [ ] **Implement a Backwards App** 🔄
  - Enable users to prompt a design by describing desired UI components, generating a Figma design from the description.
  - This feature will bridge the gap for users who may start with a conceptual idea or code and wish to visualize it in Figma before proceeding with development.
